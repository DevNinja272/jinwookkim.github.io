**Notes on [Patriot Missile 1](http://course1.winona.edu/ppaulson/Spring2013/MIS362/Assignments/Assignment04/patriot_bug.pdf)**

The computers used a 24 bit fixed-point registers. After 8 hours of operation, the targeting inaccuracy will be around the margin of 20% error. On 25th February 1991, the continuous operation operated for over 100 consecutive hours, roughly 0.34 seconds of error. 

**Notes on [Patriot Missile 2](http://www.ual.es/~plopez/docencia/itis/patriot.htm)**

The precise amount of seconds that was inaccurate is about 0.3433 seconds. Besides the roundoff error, there were more problems with the Patriot missiles that made it miss. 

**Javascript: The Good Parts**

The array in Javascript isn't as fast as other C-like languages because they store objects and not integers. However, because they store objects, some method conventions make it easier to work with Javascript arrays.



**DD: UML & SQL**

*Most of information/notes described in my blog is regurgitated info but personally, it helps me remember when I type/write it out. Excuse me for my repetition of the reading assignment.*

### Models
* Unified Modeling Language (UML): was designed for SWE of large systems using OOP. It is a large language. 
* Entry-Relationship (ER) model: used for db dev. Looks very similar to a UML class diagram.
* Relational Model (RM): formal model, developed by IBM. It is largely based on set theory and easy/powerful to implement in computers. 
* Relational Algebra (RA): formal language to simbolically manipulate objects of relational models. 
* Table Model: informal set of terms for relational model objects. The lingo is mainly used by db devs. 
* Structured Query Language (SQL):  used to build and manipulate relational dbs. Mainly based on relational algebra.

### Classes & Schemes
* Class (entity): "thing" or a fact about the enterprise or an even tthat happens in the real world. 
* Attributes (properties): is a piece of info that characterizes each member of a class in the db. Class + attributes = structure for db tables or code objects. 
* Descriptive Attributes: provides real-world info (relevant to the enterprise) about the class we are modeling. 
* Scheme: identified by the blural form of the class name, starts w/ all the attributes of class diagram. 
* Assignment Rule: associates each attribute w/ a set of legal values that may be assigned to it. 
* Domain: the values in the assignment is called the domain of the attribute. 
* CREATE TABLE:

### Rows & Tables
* Row of information is defined in the relational model as a tuple. 
* Creating a table row in SQL(INSERT INTO: 

	![Insert Into Example]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/insert_into.png)

* Changing data in a row (UPDATE): 

	![Update Example]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/update.png)

* Super Key (SK): taking a set of attributes together, guarantee uniqueness of each row. It's a property of the relation (table), filled in w/ any reasonable set of real-world data.
* Primary Key (PK): pick one of the possible super key attributes to set as a primary key. Also called a unique identifier for each row in a table. 
* Constraint: a specified primary key on the table. You can also give a constraint a name. 

* Adding a constraint example (ALTER TABLE): 
	![Alter Table Example]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/alter_table.png)

* NULL: is a special constant. It means "this field doesn't have any value assigned to it". Not the same as a zero length or the number zero.

	New CREATE TABLE example with constraints:

### Associations
* UML Association (relationship): the way that two classes are functionally connected to each other. 
* Multiplicity (Cardinality): including info about how few (minimum) and how many (maximum) individuals of one class may be connected to a single individual of the other class. 
* One-to-Many Association: looking at the maximum multiplicity at each end of the line (1 and * here).
* Foreign Key (FK): an image of the linked relation's primary key. 
* Customers are the **parent** and Orders the **child** scheme in our association. 
	* **Memorize it:** One, parent, PK; many, child FK. 
* Referential Integrity: The process of maintaining FK constraint will insure that every order contains a valid customer name and phone number.

### Keys
* Candidate Key: pick candidate key before picking the PK. keys that we can find for this table. "Candidate" key means that this set of attributes could be used as a PK, since we don't want any more attributes in the pk than are necessary. 

* There are two types of "made up" primary keys:
	* Surrogate PK: single, small attribute (such as a number) that has no descriptive value - it doesn't tell us anything about the individual. Most ID numbers are like this. This should normally be hidden by the UI of a db system.
	* Substitue PK: single, small attribute (such as an abbreviation) that has at least some descriptive value. One example is to include two-letter postal codes for the states of the US and three-letter codes for worldwide airports. 
	* External Key: An attribute where you might find that a class type already has an attribute that attribute that appreas to be a surrogate or substitute key, but has been defined by someone else. 

**What did I do this past week?**

My partner and I finalized our Netflix project and turned it in. We were somewhat satisfied with our project even though we were not able to get our RMSA < .95. The guest speaker talk was great with Bloomberg. I learned quite a bit of what kind of company they are. 

**What's in my way?**

What's in my way is project after project. Thankfully, my security class projects and SWE projects are not on the same week, they're both every other week from each other. It gives me some breathing room, but that also means that I have to be very studious every week and be able to code enough to feel comfortable of where I'm at. 

**What will I do next week?**

I am just going to get ahead in my classes like I usually do and continuing on my job search. So far, I'm getting some feedback from some companies. Hopefully I'm able to land a full time job soon!

**TIP-OF-THE-WEEK**

This website, [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) is an online resource for a LOT of materials. There's a lot about programming languages, photoshop, video editing, photo editing, and etc. Lynda is free for current students, however if you are not, then it is super expensive.
