**What did I do this past week?**    
This past week, my SWE group and I worked on our presentation for our extra credit. We presented and went over Python Logging. I also worked on my security project and my Japanese skit with my friends in my other classes. I have started studying for my final as well for all my classes. 

**What's in my way?**    
I have to start writing my cheatsheet for SWE soon and review a lot more this class. Mainly the SQL and Java stuff. 

**What will I do next week?**    
I plan to do a lot of studying for all my classes. Thursday will be the hardest day because I'll have my SWE final, security final, and my Japanese Skit that I have to perform memorized.
