*Notes*

*Elements vs Tags: HTML markup is referred to as both HTML tags and HTML elements. These terms are often used interchangeably. This refers to the HTML markup as elements.*

### Objective 1.1: Create the document structure
* **Use HTML5 semantic markup**:

    Table 1-1 (page 3) HTML5 semantic markup: article, aside, figcaption, figure, footer, header, hgroup, mark, nav, progress, section.

    *Use only what you need - when designing a webpage, you don't necessarily need to use every available element. Instead, use only the elements you need to get your job done.*

    + The **header** element isn't limited to only the start of your page - it provides a semantic way of declaring the header to any area of the webpage. The header element is intended to hold an H1-H6 element as needed.
    + The **nav** alement is meant to provide users navigation through main elements of the web document.
    + The **aside** element defines any content that doesn't fall within the main flow or main content of the current page - for example, a sidebar, a note, an alert, or an advertisement.
    + The **hgroup** element is used to organize headers and subheaders.
    + The **article** element represents a whole and complete composition or entry. Ex: magazine article or a blog post. Typically, the first element within the article element is a header element or header group.
    + Similarly to the article element, the **section** element subdivides pages into section. Articles are not meant to break down into granular pieces, but sections are. Like the article element, the first element within a section element is typically a header or a header group.
    + The **figcaption** and **figure** elements, new in HTML5, provide graphics and figures to webpages. Kind of like those science textbook examples.
    + The **progress** element represents the process of an objective or task. The two supported types of progress tasks are determinate and indeterminate.
    + The **mark** element, you can easily highlight important information or any text you want to emphasize. Basically a highlighter. Just call style background color on it to choose color.

* **Create a layout container in HTML**
    + The two most common methods of creating a layout in HTML involve using **div** and **table** elements.
    + **div**s are often used to divide the page into various sections to create the layout.
    + The **table** element is very flexible with additional elements like **thead** and **tfoot**, but it is also very static in its structure. Mainly because it is not scalable.

* **Optimize for search engines**
    + Search engine optimization (SEO) is a technique used to make elements of the website easily discoverable and appropriately indexed by search engines, so that when users search for content related to your site, they find your pages.
    + The **article** and **section** elements are the main ones used by the SEO algorithm.

* **Optimize for screen readers**
    + Recommended to use **h1** elements be used solely throughout an HTML5 document. Instead of using h1-h6, keep using h1 but separated and nested with **section** elements.

* **Thought Experiement:**
    + You have just been hired to convert an existing website to the new HTML5 semantic markup. Analyze the following HTML and determine what elements should be updated to fully leverage the HTML5 semantic markup:

* **Objective Summary**
    + HTML5 introduced new semantic elements to more clearly define sections of an HTML page. THese elements include `<section>, <article>, <nav>, <header>, <footer>, <aside>, <progress>, <mark>, <figure>, and <figcaption`.
    + Elements within an HTML page can have their layout controlled when they are included inside structures such as `<div>` elements and/or HTML tables.
    + HTML5 semantic elements provide the mechanisms necessary to structure the page more easily for accessibility via screen readers.
    + Search engines take advantage of HTML5 semantics by leveraging the `<article>` element to determine the purpose of the page.

* **Objective Review**
    1. Which of the following elements aren't introduced in HTML5?
        + D: The `<input>` element isn't new to HTML5. However, new input types have been introduced to the specification.
    2. Which element(s) does the `hgroup` element contain?
        + A: The `<hgroup>` element is expected to contain any or all of the `<h1>` to `<h6>` elements.
    3. Which HTML5 element would you use to organize content so that the page maximizes a search engine's algorithm?
        + C: The `<article>` element tells the search engine that specific content in this area is relevant to what users are searching for. This element provides for the best search engine optimization.
    4. Which HTML5 element should you use to create a more structure layout?
        + C: You use the `<table` element to provide a structured layout, using its rows and columns elements as needed to create the desired layout.

### Objective 1.2: Write code that interacts with UI controls
* **Add or modify HTML elements**
    + **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a representation of the structure of your HTML page that you can interact with programmatically.

    *The DOM as a family tree: the DOM is essentially a collection of nodes arranged in a tree. All the nodes are related to each other. They are one big happy family of children, siblings, parents, grandparents, grandchildtren, and so on. This essence of a family tree represents the hierarchy of the DOM and is important to understand as you manipulate the DOM through code.*

    + You can access DOM elements through a global object provided by the browser, called *document*, or through the elements themselves after you obtain a reference to one.

     Table 1-2 (page 23) Methods available for selecting DOM elements: getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, querySelectorAll

    + **getElementById** method is great when you know the ID of a specific element in the page that you want to work with.
    + **alert** isn't all that useful in the real world but it is for development purposes.
    + **innerHTML** displays all the contents you selected out of the DOM within the code
    + **getElementsByTagName** is more appropriate to get all elements of a particular type. It's a special type that acts as a wrapper to all the elements that match your parameter called a **NodeList**.
    ```
    var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
    alert(paragraphs.length);
    ```
    + **getElementsByClassName** is practically the same at **getElementsByTagName** but with classes. This method also returns a **NodeList**.
    + When selecting elements in the DOM by class name, the **NodeList** contains all elements whose class matches the specified class - not just elements of the same type. For example, if a **div** and a **p** have both the same class name, the **NodeList** will have both.
    + The **querySelector** method returns the first element it finds that matches the selector criteria passed to it.
    + Whereas **querySelectorAll** method returns all elements that match the selector criteria passed in.
    + **document.removeChild** will remove the element, so it will not be able to be referred back to it again.
    + **document.createElement** will create a new element inside the DOM. This also returns a reference to the new element appended to the child elements.
    Example:
    ```
    var element = document.createElement("article");
    element.innerText = "My new <article> element";
    ```
    + Use **appendChild** to add on created elements from javascript.
    Example:
    ```
    var outerDiv = document.getElementById("outerDiv");
    var element = document.createElement("article");
    element.innerText = "My new <article> element";
    outerDiv.appendChild(element);
    ```
    Alternative:
    ```
    var element = document.getElementById("outerDiv").appendChild(document.createElement("article"));
    element.innerText = "My new <article> element";
    ```
    + Use **insertBefore** to put the article element somewhere more precise. Takes two params: the new element itself, and the node before which you want to append the new element.

    Table 1-3 (page 31) Properties available on a DOM element: childNodes, firstChild, lastChild, hasChildNodes

    + To remove elements inside the DOM you can use either **removeChild** and **removeNode**. For **removeChild**, you can keep a reference of it to reuse and put back in next time. However, if you set **removeNode** as true, then it shall be a deep removal.

> Exam Tip:
    jQuery is probably the most popular library available to date for simplifying and extending the core Javascript capabilities. Although jQuery isn't a Microsoft technology, it's essentially an industry standard and fully supported by Microsoft. As such, web developers today are generally understood to have a grasp of using jQuery interchangeably with core JavaScript. The exam will expect that you can use jQuery effectively in place of the document object selector methods.


* **Implement media controls**
    + **video** example:
    ```
    <video src="samplevideo.mp4" autoplay></video>
    ```

    Table 1-4 (page 35) Attributes available on the `<video>` element: src, autoplay, controls, height/width, loop, poster

    If you don't have all the appropriate supported video formats and your page happens to get a visitor with a browser that can't play the video format you have, you also need to provide an alternative or at least the information that the user's browser doesn't support this video.
    Example:
    ```
    <video controls height="400" width="600" poster="picture.jpg">
        <source src-"samplevideo.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
        <source src="samplevideo.mp4" type="audio/mp4" />
        <object>
            <p>Video is not supported by this browser.</p>
        </object>
    </video>
    ```
    The example has an `<object>` element to cover the possibility that the client browser has no support for the `<video>` element at all.

    >Exam tip: If the browser supports the HTML5 video element, it doesn't show the fallback. In this case, make sure that you have the valid <source> element specified for that browser. If you don't, the video container shows an error in place of the control bar, saying that an invalid link or file is specified.

    Table 1-5 (page 38) Methods and properties on the `<video>` object: play(), pause(), volume, currentTime

    + The `<audio>` element is essentially identical to the `<video>` element.
    Example:
    ```
    <audio controls>
        <source src="sample.mp3" type="audio/mp3"/>
        <source src="sample.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/>
        <p>Your browser does not support HTML5 audio.</p>
    </audio>
    ```

* **Implement graphics with HTML5 canvas and SVG**
    + You can use `<canvas>` to draw lines, text, and images on the canvas and manipulate them with JavaScript.

    Table 1-6 (page 41) Methods for drawing lines: beginPath, moveTo, lineTo, stroke
    + Make sure to give your line properties before the **stroke** method.

    Table 1-7 (page 43) Methods for drawing curves: arc, quadraticCurveTo, bezierCurveTo

    The arc method takes the parameters listed in Table 1-8;
    Table 1-8 (page 44) Parameters required to draw an arc: X and Y, radius, startAngle and endAngle, counterclockwise

    + **quadraticArc** is evenly distributed from one end to the other in terms of its distance from the center point.
    + **quadraticCurveTo** method allows you to specify some additional parameters to alter the "steepness" of the curve - in other words, to change the distance from the center point along the curve.

    Table 1-9 (page 45) Parameters required for the quadraticCureTo method: controlX and controlY, endX and endY

    + You need to pass three sets of coordinates to the **bezierCurveTo** method, as listed in Table 1-10.
    Table 1-10 (page 46) Parameters required for the bezierCurveTo method: controlX and controlY, Control2X and control2Y, endX and endY
    + The **rect** method takes the parameters listed in Table 1-11.
    Table 1-11 (page 48) Parameters required for drawing rectangles: x and y, width, height
    + Filling a shape with a color is as simple as setting the **fillstyle** property to a color and calling the **fill** method.
    + With respect to the **rect** method, you get a special **fill** method specifically for **rect** called **fillRect**.
    + Creating a gradient involves using a new **CanvasGradient** object. You first call the **createLinearGradient** method available on the context object to get a **CanvasGradient** object. On that **CanvasGradient** object, you define the color stops that you want to blend to create the gradient effect. Then you assign your **CanvasGradient** object to the **fillStyle** property of the context.
    + The **addColorStop** meethod takes two parameters. The first is a value from 0 to 1, where 0 is the starting point of the gradient line and 1 is the ending point. The second parameter is the color to start filling with at that stop. This example has three stops, so the gradient transitions through three colors.
    + You can also create a radial gradient using the **createRadialGradient** method. This method takes six parameters, which specify the center point and radius of two circles and the color transitions through the stops along the cone formed by the two circles.
    + The **createPattern** method passes a reference to an Image object and a repeat pattern. The repeat pattern can be *no-repeat*, *repeat-x*, or *repeat-y*, but it defaults to *repeat* if you don't specify anything. You need to assign an event handler to the onload event of the Image object to ensure that you draw the pattern only after the image loads. Otherwise, the code could run before the picture is rendered, and the pattern won't display.
    + To draw an image on a canvas, you use the **drawImage** method of the context object. This method takes an Image object and some(x,y) coordinates to define where the image should be drawn. If you want to resize the image, you can replace the **drawImage** method call with the following line:  `ctxt.drawImage(img,0,0,img.width*.5,img.height*.5);`
    + To draw text: `ctxt.strokeText("1. Text with default font",100,100);`. The *strokeText* call draws the specified text into the specified coordinates on the canvas.
    + To draw outlined, colored text:
        ```
        ctxt.font = "24px arial";
        ctxt.textAlign = "center";
        ctxt.strokeStyle = "Red";
        ctxt.strokeText("Text with altered colored font centered",drawingSurface.width/2,drawingSurface.height/2);
        ```
    + To draw color-filled text:
    ```
    ctxt.font = "24px arial";
    ctxt.textAlign = "center";
    ctxt.fillStyle = "Red";
    ctxt.fillText("Text with altered colored font centered",drawingSurface.width/2,drawingSurface.height/2);
    ```

    + Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based language for creating two-dimensional graphics.

    > Exam Tip:
        In some cases, using SVG graphics is simpler than using the <canvas> element. As the examples have shown, you can create SVG images declaratively directly within the HTML itself. However, as you increase the number of objects in an SVG rendering, performance can become a concern. In cases where performance is a consideration, using the <canvas> element is a preferable approach.
        Performance: Canvas > SVG

* **Thought Experiement:**
    + You were hired to create a game. For the first stage of the game, you must make a ball move from the left side of the screen to right side. How can you achieve this with the HTML5 <canvas> element? How about with SVG? You demonstrate this stage to stakeholders, and they love it. For the next stage, when the ball is clicked, it must split into two balls. As the number of balls increases due to being clicked, what considerations need to be taken into account? Would using SVG or the `<canvas>` element be better solution for this game?

    + This thought experiment speaks directly to performance. As the number of balls increases, the demand on the graphics engine and local resources such as CPU and memory becomes more intense. The `<canvas>` element is better designed to perform this duty. From a coding perspective, this experiement provides insight into capturing events from the canvas, calculating the location of the click in relation to the balls on the screen, and creating new balls dynamically as they get clicked. These computations need to occur quickly as the graphics are redrawn. The implementation of such a game would be too involved for the scope of this book. However, the notion of performance is an important concept to be clear on with respect to graphics rendering.

* **Objective Summary**
    + JavaScript is a powerful tool that enables developers to manipulate the DOM prgrammatically in the browser
    + HTML5 supports rich media controls to incorporate video by using the `<video>` element and audio by using the `<audio>` element.
    + The `<video>` element supports multiple media formats by using the `<source>` element.
    + The HTML5 `<canvas>` and `<svg>` elements support a rich API to create both simple and complex graphics in the browser.
    + Both the `<canvas>` and `<svg>` graphics engines can draw text, lines, shapes, fonts, fills, and gradients.
    + The `<canvas>` element is drawn on via JavaScript by getting a reference to the context.
    + The `<svg>` element renders graphics by using a declarative syntax.

* **Objective Review**
    1. Which of the following JavaScript methods can't be used to select an element in the DOM?
        + D: The *queryAll* method isn't available to search the DOM.
    2. Which line of JavaScript successfully retrieves only the image element with the ID *myDog* from the following HTML? Choose all that apply.
    ```
    <form>
        <div id="main" class="mainStyle">
            <p id="dogs">
                This is a web page about dogs. Here is my dog picture:
                <img src="dog.jpg" id="myDog" class"thumb"/>
                Here is a picture of my friend's dog:
                <img src="dog.jpg" id="myfriendsDog" class="thumb"/>
            </p>
        </div>
    </form>
    ```

        + A: document.getElementbyID("myDog"); retrieves only the single image with the ID myDog.

    3. To hide an element in the DOM and still be able to add it back later, what should you do?
        + B: When an element is removed and needed again, a reference to the removed node to be able to add it back.
    4. When implementing the HTML5 video element, how do you ensure that the rendering of the element can function in different browsers?
        + C: The `<source>` elements specify multiple video formats so that the browser can choose the correct one.
    5. When drawing on the HTML5 `<canvas>` element, what method is used on the context to begin drawing at the new point?
        + C: The *beginPath* method tells the context to start a new drawing from its current point.
    6. When performance is critical for an HTML5 graphics application, what should you use?
        + C: The `<canvas` element provides superior performance compared to the `<svg` element.

### Objective 1.3: Apply styling to HTML elements programmatically

* **Change the location of an element**
    + You can position elements by using *absolute positioning* or *relative positioning*. With absolute positioning, the element is placed in the exact location specified, relative to its container's borders. However, with relative positioning, the element is positioned relative to its immediate left sibling's coordinates.
    + You can apply four properties individually or in combination to control the position of an element: *Top*, *Left*, *Right*, and *Bottom*. Each property takes a distance parameter that specifies the relative distance of the object from a reference point based on the positioning attribute specified.

* **Apply a transform**
    + To add a transform to an element, you declare it in the CSS for the element by adding the *transform* property as follows:
    `.rota {transform: rotate(90deg);}
    + The *rotate* transform method enables you to rotate an object by a specified number of degrees. The method accepts a single parameter that specifies the number of degrees.
    + The transform also supports the *rotateX* and *rotateY* methods, which accept a single parameter in degrees to specify an angle around the x-axis or y-axis in which to rotate.
    + The *translate* method lets you move an HTML element by changing its relative X and Y position on the page.
    `transform: translate(50px,0px);`
    + *translateX* and *translateY* methods are available if the desired effect is to move the object around the x-axis or y-axis.
    + You can skew an HTML element using the *skew* method of the *transform* property. Skewing slants the object so that it's not parallel to the vertical or horizontal axis.
    `transform: skew(10deg, 10deg);
    + The *scale* method enables you to resize elements by a specified ratio. The *scale* method takes one parameter: a decimal value that represents the percentage to scale. Specifying a value greater than 1 makes the object larger; specifying a value less than 1 but greater than 0 makes the object smaller. Specifying a value of -1 flips the object over its horizontal axis.
    `transform: scale(1.5);
    + How to combine transformations:
    `transform: translate(50px,0px) scale(1.5) skew(10deg,10deg);`

* **Show and hide elements**
    + The *display* property accepts two possible values. A value of *inline* tells the browser to show the item, while a value of *none* means the browser should hide the item.
    + The second property available for controlling element visibility is called *visibility*. This property accepts four possible values.

    Table 1-12 (page 68) Values available for the *visibility* property: visible, hidden, collapse, inherit
    + The *visibility* CSS property behaves slightly differently. Setting the *visibility* property to *hidden* hides an element, but the hidden element's surrounding elements act as thought it's still there. Set it back to *visible* to see it.
    + The *collapse* value, on the other hand, acts more like the *display* property. If you specify *collapse* on something such as a table row, the table rows above and below collapse and take over the space that the collapsed row was occupying.

    > Exam Tip:
        If you need to perserve the page layout when altering visibility, use the *visibility* property with the *hidden* value. If you don't need to preserve the layout, you can either set the *display* property to *none* or set *visibility* to *collapse*.

* **Thought Experiment**
    + You have been tasked with building a webpage that requires a user to answer a series of questions. However, the questions are dynamic, based on the user's answer to a previous question. The user should see only relevant questions. Take the following question flow as the rules for this page:
        + Q1 > y > Q2 > y > Q4 > Q10
        + Q1 > y > Q2 > n > Q5 > Q10
        + Q1 > n > Q3 > Q6 > y > Q7 > Q9 > Q10
        + Q1 > n > Q3 > Q6 > n > Q8 > Q9 > Q10
    + And the following HTML5 page:
    ```

    Create all the JavaScript necessary to show and hide the required elements, depending on the answer to each question. Assume that the answer to each question is a radio button selection with only Yes/No options.

    To complete this thought experiment, you must get a reference to the DOM via JavaScript and set up events for the click to each radio button. When an event is created for notification of the selection of each radio button, the questions can be shown/hidden as needed. Setting the display CSS attribute of the elements so that the questions present in flow is key. The desired effect is for the surrounding elements to behave as though the element is no longer part of the DOM. Setting display none achieves this effect.

* **Objective Summary**
    + You can use CSS to define transformation effects.
    + You can apply transformation via JavaScript to manipulate the DOM with effects such as rotate, skew, scale, and translate.
    + The *visibility* property provides options to control an element's visibility within the page.

* **Objective Review**
    1. Absolute positioning positions an object relative to what?
        + B: Absolute positioning positions the element relative to its parent element.
    2. Which transformation enables you to change the size of an element?
        + D: The *scale* transform changes the size of an object.
    3. Which syntax preserves the layout of the page when hiding an element in the DOM?
        + D: Visibility='hidden' hides an element, and its surrounding elements remain in place as though the element was still there.

### Objective 1.4: Implement HTML5 APIs
* **Using the storage API**
    + WebA Storage is a new API for storing webpage data locally. Web Storage replaces the concept of cookies.

    > Note: Browser Support
        Of course, you must consider your audience's browser support for HTML5 and Web Storage before you choose to use it exclusively.

    + *local* storage is persistent; data stored in local storage is available to the webpage even if the user closes the browser completely and then reopens it to your site.
    + *session* storage is available only for the duration of the current session, so if the user closes the browser, session storage is automatically cleared up and is no longer available.
    + Web Storage API is available as a global object. To access local storage, use the *localStorage* object; to access session storage, use the *sessionStorage* object.

    > EXAM TIP:
        The *localStorage and *sessionStorage* objects provide exactly the same API. All the examples shown in this section work exactly the same with either object. The only difference is the lifetime of the storage. Remember that *sessionStorage* is cleared when the session is closed whereas *localStorage* is still accessible after a session closes and a new session opens.

    + Web Storage is implemented as name value pairs and stored as strings. Any data that you can put into a string format can be stored in Web Storage.

    Table 1-13 (page 73) Methods available on storage object: setItem, getItem, clear, key, removeItem
    In addition to the methods in table 1-13, the storage objects expose a length property which returns the number of key/value pairs in storage.

    Local and Session Storage Example:

* **Using the AppCache API**
    + The AppCache API makes content and webpages available even when a web application is in offline mode. Two components make up the AppCache API: the manifest file and a JavaScript API to support it.
    + Using AppCache manifest example:
        ```
        <html manifest="webApp.appcache">...</html>
        ```
    The nameof the file is a convention more than a requirement; you can name the file anything, but hte file extension is usually *.appcache*.

    > EXAM TIP:
        If you really want to change the file extension, you need to configure the web server so that your chosen file extension is returned with a MIME type of text/cache-manifest.

    + The manifest file contains three sections: CACHE, NETWORK, and FALLBACK. Each section might appear just once, multiple times in the file, or not at all. Each serves a specific purpose in how application caching functions when dealing with the resources in specific scenarios.

    A typical manifest file looks like this:
    ```
    CACHE MANIFEST
    # My Web Application Cache Manifest
    # v.1.0.0.25
    #
    # Cache Section. All Cached items.
    Cache
    /pages/page1.html
    /pages/page2.html

    # Required Network resources
    NETWORK:
    login.html

    # Fallback items.
    FALLBACK:
    login.html fallback-login.html
    ```

    The CACHE section lists all the resources that must be cached offline. This must include all CSS files, JPG files, video and audio files, and any other resource required for the page to function correctly.
    The NETWORK section declares any resources that *must* be available from the Internet. These items can't be cached.
    The FALLBACK section enables you to provide fallback instructions to the browser in the event that an item isn't available in the cache and the browser is in offline mode.
    The following code gets a reference to the AppCache global object:
    ```
    var appCache = window.applicationCache;
    ```
    + When using the application cache to make pages available offline, one of the more useful things you can do when page is loaded is verify its status. You achieve this by evaluating the *status* property of the AppCache object.

    Table 1-14 (page 79) The application cache *status* property: Uncached, Idle, Checking, Downloading, UpdateReady, Obsolete

    Table 1-15 (page 79) Methods available with the *applicationCache* object: swapCache, update

    When the *update* method is called, an update to the cache is prepared. When that's ready to download, the status of the application cache changes to *UpdateReadY*. When this is set, a call to the *swapCache* method tells the application to switch to the most recent cache.

    > EXAM TIP:
        The call to the *update* method is asynchronous. Therefore, you must handle the *onupdateread* event to determine when the update has completed the download process.

    Table 1-16 (page 80) Events available from the *applicationCache* object: onchecking, onnoupdate, ondownloading, onprogress, oncached, onupdateready, onobsolete, onerror.

    + The most common scenario is to handle the *onupdateready* method and then make a call to the *swapCache* method, as in this example:
    ```
    window.onload = function() {
        var appCache = window.applicationCache;
        appCache.oncached = function (e) { alert("cache successfully downloaded."); };
        appCache.onupdateready = function (e) { appCache.swapCache(); };
    ```

* **Using the GeolocationAPI**
    + You can get a reference to the Geolocation API from the *window.navigator* property, as follows:
    ```
    var geoLocator = window.navigator.geolocation;
    ```

    The Geolocation API supports three key methods that you use to interact with it: *getCurrentPosition*, *watchPosition*, and *clearWatch*.

    *getCurrentPosition* method example:
    ```
    getCurrentPosition(positionalCallback, [positionErrorCallback], [positionOptions])
    ```

    Table 1-17 (page 81) Properties available on the *PositionOptions* object: enableHighAccuracy, timeout, maximumAge.

    The position object exposes two properties: *coords* and *timestamp*. The *timestamp* property indicates the time at which the *coords* were received. The *coords* property is itself a coordinates object that contains the latitude, longitude, altitude, heading, and speed of the device's current position and/or relative to the last position acquired. The *positionError* object contains two properties: one for the code and one for the message.
     + The second method available on the geolocation object is the *watchPosition* method, which provides a built-in mechanism that continuously polls for the current position.
     Example:
     ```
     geoLocator.watchPosition(successCallBack, errorCallback, positionOptions)
     ```

     The *watchPosition* method takes the same set of parameters as the *getCurrentPosition* method but returns a *watchPosition* object:
     ```
     var watcher = geoLocator.watchPosition...
     ```
     You can cancel polling by calling the *clearWatch* method.
     ```
     geoLocator.clearWatch(watcher);
     ```

     Example:
     ```
     <script>
        var watcher;
        var geoLocator;
        window.onload = function () {
            geoLocator = window.navigator.geolocation;
            var posOptions = {enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 45000};

            watcher = geoLocator.watchPosition(successPosition, errorPosition, posOptions);
        }

         function successPosition(pos) {
             var sp = document.createElement("p");
             sp.innerText = "Laititude: " + pos.coords.latitude + " Longitude: " + pos.coords.longitude;
             document.getElementById("geoResults").appendChild(sp);
             geoLocator.clearWatch(watcher);
         }
         function errorPosition(err) {
             var sp = document.createElement("p");
             sp.innerText = "error: " + err.message; + " code: " + err.code;
             document.getElementById("geoResults").appendChild(sp);
         }
     </script>
     ```

* **Thought Experiment**
    + Combining the JavaScript APIs: Consider an application such as a running or walking utility that measures the distance traveled. One feature of this application is to play back a completed route to users if they so choose. How would you use the Geolocation API and Web Storage API in combination to save the data points as users travel the route so the application can play them back later? (Assume that you're interfacing with map software on which to draw the lines.)

    Answer:
    ```
    <script>
        var watcher;
        var geoLocator;
        var positions = 0;
        window.onload = function () {
            geoLocator = window.navigator.geolocation;
            var posOptions = { enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 45000 };
            watcher = geoLocator.watchPosition(successPosition, errorPosition, posOptions);
        }
        function successPosition(pos) {
            // on each position, store it into local storage sequentially.
            // Then it can be retrieved sequentially
            // in order to redraw the route on a map.
            var p = "Lat: " + pos.coords.latitude + " Long: " + pos.coords.longitude;
            localStorage.setItem(position, p);
        }
        function errorPosition(err) {
            var sp = document.createElement("p");
            sp.innerText = "error: " + err.message + " code: " + err.code;
            document.getElementById("geoResults").appendChild(sp);
        }
    </script>
    ```

* **Objective Summary**
    + The new Web Storage API enables you to store data locally on the client computer.
    + Web Storage supports both *localStorage* and *sessionStorage*.
    + Data in Web Storage is stored as name and value pairs.
    + The AppCache API provides a way to make webpages available when users are offline.
    + The AppCache manifest defines what's available offline.
    + The Geolocation API provides a way to integrate location services into a webpage.
    + The Geolocation API provides two methods: *getPosition* and *watchPosition*

* **Objective Review**
    1. When using the Web Storage API, where should you store data to ensure that it's cleared when the user closes the browser?
        + C: *sessionStorage* clears when the session closes.
    2. What do you need to do to designate a page as available offline?
        + C: Specifying the manifest attribute on the HTML element is the correct action.
    3. Which of the following aren't valid sections of the AppCache manifest?
        + B: Session manifest isn't a valid option.
    4. Which event is fired by the AppCache object when the cache download is complete?
        + A: The *oncached* event is fired when the download completes.
    5. When using the Geolocation API, how do you configure the ability to use cached data?
        + B: Set the *maximumAge* property to a non-zero value on the *PositionOptions* object.

### Objective 1.5: Establish the scope of objects and variables
* **Establish the lifetime of variables and variable scope**
    + To declare a vaariable in JavaScript, you use the *var* keyword:
    ```
    var myVariable;
    var x,y,z;
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0
    ```
    Until a variable is initialized, it's not really "alive" - it has a value of **undefined**.

* **Avoid using the global namescape**
    + One strategy to avoid name collisions is to create your own namespaces for your JS libraries.
    Namespace example for a library developed for a bookstore:
    ```
    var com = {};
    com.Bookstore = {};
    com.Bookstore.Book = {
        title: 'my book',
        genre: 'fiction;
    };
    com.Bookstore.Author = {
        firstName: 'R',
        lastname: 'D'
    }
    ```

* **Leverage the *this* keyword**

    + Leveraging the *this* keyword: the keyword *this* is a special term that allows JS developers to reference the containing object directly.
    Example:
    ```
    <script>
        // Here, "this" references the global namespace
        this.navigator.geolocation
        window.onload = function () {
            // Here, "this" references the window object
            thiss...
            document.getElementById("aDiv").onclick = function ()
            {
                //Here, "this" references the DIV element
                this...
            }
        }
    </script>
    ```

* **Thought Experiment**
    + Building a custom object library: You need to create multiple websites that all leverage the same backend database. You will use AJAX to make server requests for data. You want to create a custom library that can be used among the various websites. You are concerned about naming objects because you know that many other libraries are integrated with the overall solution.
    How can you design your library so that it doesn't conflict with other libraries in use?

    Answer: In this experiment, you took a look at a real-world scenario where the addition of JS libraries could potentially conflict w/ other libraries already in use. This is a case for using namespaces to scope the library with unique fully qualified name to ensure that it's distinct from any other. Review the objective on the use of the global namespace to ensure that you understand this concept for the exam.

* **Objective Summary**
    + Variables are undefined until they are initialized
    + Variables are scoped and accessible depending on where they are declared. If they are inside a function, for example, they are local to the function.
    + Passing parameteres is the only way to make a local variable available in another function.
    + The global namespace shouldn't be used because it's shared by all.
    + You should apply a namespace to custom objects to prevent conflicts in the global namespace.
    + The *this* keyword provides direct access to the object that raised the event.

* **Objective Review**
    1. In JS, how do you determine the scope of a variable?
        + B: The scope of a variable depends on where inside the script it's declared.
    2. Why is it important to avoid creating custom JS objects in the global namespace?
        + B: The global namespace is available to all applications in the session, and using it could result in a naming conflict.
    3. What JS keyword in an event handler can be easily used to reference the object that raised the event?
        + C: The *this* keyword provides a reference to the object.

### Objective 1.6: Create and implement objects and methods
Essentially, two types of objects exist in JS:
    + Native JS objects, which are provided with JS itself
    + Custom objects, which developers create to represent their own data constructs and behaviors

* **Implement Native Objects**
    + *Native objects* are available to developers directly through JS.
    + One example of a static object is *Math*,  which is available in the global namespace and provides a great deal of functionality w/o you having to create and instance:
    ```
    var squareValue = Math.sqrt(144);
    ```
    Other objects, such as *Array* shown in the following code, require you to create an instance to work with them:
    ```
    var listofPrimeNumbers = new Array(1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23);
    ```
    The code introduces the *new* keyword, which you use to instantiate an object.
    The addition of multiple constructors is called an *overloaded constructor*.
    + JS also provides wrapper objects. These wrap up native types, for example. Native types are defined as ints, strs, chars, and so on.
    When a variable is declared like this:
    ```
    var txt = "my long string";
    var num = 5;`
    ```
    you can access method on the variable like this:
    ```
    var index = txt.indexOf("long", 0);
    var exp = num.toExponential(5);
    ```

* **Create custom objects and custom properties for native projects using prototypes and functions**
    + Book example with properties and functions:
    ```
    var book = {
        ISBN: "55555555",
        Lenght: 560,
        genre: "programming",
        covering: "soft",
        author: "John Doe",
        currentPage: 5,
        title: "My Big Book of Wonderful Things",
        flipto: function flipToAPage(pNum) {
            this.currentPage = pNum;
        },
        turnPageForward: function turnForward() {
            this.flipTo(this.currentPage++);
        },
        turnPageBackward: function turnBackward() {
            this.flipTo(this.currentPage--);
        }
    }
    ```
    + If you plan to use an object often, consider creating a *prototype* for it so that you can construct one whenever you need it. A prototype provides a definition of the object so that you can construct the object using the new keyword.
    Prototype for the *book* object:
    ```
    function Book()
    {
        //just creates an empty book.
    }
    function Book(title, length, author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.Length = length;
        this.author = author;
    }
    Book.prototype = {
        ISBN: "",
        Length: -1,
        genre: "",
        covering: "",
        // author: "",
        author: new Author(),
        currentPage: 0,
        title: "",
        flipTo: function FlipToAPage(pNum) {
            this.currentPage = pNum;
        },
        turnPageForward: function turnForward() {
            this.flipTo(this.currentPage++);
        },
        turnPageBackward: function turnBackward() {
            this.flipTo(this.currentPage--);
        }
    };
    function Author() {
    }
    function Author(firstName, lastName, gender)
    {
        this.firstname = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.gender = gender;
    }
    Author.prototype = {
        firstName:"",
        lastName:"",
        gender:"",
        BookCount: 0
    }
    var books = new Array(new Book(), new Book("First Edition", 350, new Author("Random","Author","M")));
    ```


    > EXAM TIP:
        JS consists of objects. Everything in JS is an object. Each object is based on a prototype. Whenever you create a new instance of an object, that instance is based on the object's prototype.


    > EXAM TIP:
        You can add properties to a prototype dynamically rather than use the preceding method. The following code achieves the same outcome. Using such code is just a matter of preference.
        ```
        Book.prototype.ISBN = "";
        Book.prototype.Length = 350;
        Book.prototype.genre = "";
        Book.prototype.covering = "";
        Book.prototype.author = new Author();
        Book.prototype.currentPage = 0;
        Book.prototype.title = "";
        ```

* **Implement inheritance**
    + You can extend the *Book* object in a couple of ways. (Extending is another way of thinking about inheritance - an object is extended into another object.) Here's the first way to extend an object:
    ```
    var popupBook = Object.create(Book.protoType,
        {
            hasSound : {value: true},
            showPopUp: {value: function showPop()
                {
                    //do logic to show a popup
                }
            }
        });
    ```
    *Object.create* is a method available from the *Object* class in the global namespace. The create method takes two params: the object you want to create and a list of property descriptors.

    Modular way:
    ```
    function PopUpBook() {
        Book.call(this);
    }
    PopUpBook.prototype = Book.prototype;
    PopUpBook.prototype.hasSound = false;
    PopUpBook.prototype.showPopUp = function ShowPop() { };
    ```
    Book.call(..) is a call to the constructor of the super class (the class being inherited from).

* **Thought Experiment**
    + Creating synergy b/w custom objects and native objects: In this objective you've seen the use of native objects and custom objects. How would you bring those two worlds together? In JS, inheriting from native objects is not fully supported. However, what if you wanted to add functionality to native objects by extending them? How would you go about doing this?

    Answer:
    To extend a native object, you must add functionality to its prototype. This isn't ideal object orientation in all cases; however, it does provide another avenue to achieve the desired results. JS objects are dynamic, meaning that the prototype can be modified to add functionality to them. In this example, you extend the *Array* object to provide a *sum* method that returns the sum of all elements in the array.
    For this type of example, type safety is a concern. Arrays can hold any type of data. True inheritance would allow you to create a special type of array to hold only numbers. In this code, you can dadd validation to ensure that the values in the array are numeric or add only the numeric values. However, for the sake of demonstrating the extension of the object, this same omits that validation. The following code shows how you can extend the *Array* object to support a *sum* method by adding a new method to its prototype:
    ```
    Array.prototype.sum = function () {
        var res = 0;
        for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++)
            res += this[i];
        return res;
    };
    var x = new Array(2);
    x[0] = 5;
    x[1] = 6;
    document.write(x.sum());
    ```


* **Objective Summary**
    + Everything in JS is an object - even functions
    + JS supports native objects and custom objects
    + Objects are created with the *new* keyword
    + Access methods and properties on objects with the dot notation: *object.method* or *object.property*
    + You can create custom objects dynamically or by using prototypes
    + Prototypes provide for object definition reuse, whereas dynamic objects require attributes and methods defined for each use
    + Inheritance is achieved in JS through the extension of prototypes

* **Objective Review**
    1. In JS, which of the following isn't a native object?
        + D: People aren't native JS objects
    2. Which of the following snippets shows the correct way to create a custom book object?
        + B: var book = { Title: "My book about things", Author: "Jane Doe", Pages: 400 }; This code segment creates a dynamic object.
    3. Inheritance is accomplished in JS through the use of which construct?
        + D: prototypes are used to create inheritance trees in JS
