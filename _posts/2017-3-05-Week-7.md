**Notes on [The Liskov Substitution Principle](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/fares/papers/LSP.pdf)**

> Functions that uses pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it. 

* One of the most glaring violations of the LSP is the use of C++ Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) to select a function based upon the type of an object.

* This use of the ISA relationship is considered by many to be one of the fundamental techniques of Object Orient Analysis. 

* Validity is not Intrinsic:
	* A model, viewed in isolation, cannot be meaningfully validated. The validity of a model can only be expressed in terms of its clients.

* The LSP makes clear that in OOD the ISA relationship pertains to behavior. Not intrinsic private behavior, but extrinsic public behavior.

**Notes on [The Interface Segratation Principle](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/fares/papers/ISP.pdf)**

* The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
	> Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. 

**What did I do this past week?**

This past week I studied a lot for the SWE test and make my cheatsheet. I also have made some initiatives to find partners for our new project for SWE. 

**What's in my way?**

What's in my way right now is that our group only need one more person for our group now. Also, another thing that would be hard is probably initiate our groups together. Last thing that'd be in my way for this week is my security test this week and also another project for security. 

**What will I do next week?**

What I will do next week is work on our group project and apply for more jobs!

**TIP-OF-THE-WEEK**

If you ever wanted to customize your desktop, you can use [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/). You can add other people's skins to have a music visualizer, show your percentage of cpu usage, ram usage, cpu temps, and etc.
