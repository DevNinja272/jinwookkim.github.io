### Access and secure data
*Static* data is written directly into the HTML markup, not altered or loaded by code such as JS.
*Dynamic* data can change.

### Objective 3.1: Validate user input by using HTML5 elements
> NOTE: INPUT CONTROLS
    The HTML5 specification defines many more input controls than are explained in this book. This book focuses specifically on the controls now supported by IE, followed by smaller examples to demonstrate some of the other controls as supported by other browsers such as Google Chrome.

THe `<input>` element in HTML denotes input controls. This element contains a *type* attribute that speccifies the type of input element to render. The exceptions to the `<input type=">` rule are the `<textarea>` and `<button>` elements, which have their own element support.

Table 3-1 (page 193) HTML5 input elements: color*, date*, datetime*, month*, week*, time*, number*, Range, tel*, url, Radio', Checkbox', Password', Button', Reset', Submit'

*Not supported currently by IE
'Not new in HTML5

A *text* box provides a single-line text entry, whereas a *textare* allows for a multiline data entry. The *rows* and *cols* attributes define the viewable size of the text area. Other attributes that help with controlling how much information is entered into the text fields is the *maxlength* attribute.
`<input type="text" id="firstNameText" maxlength="50"/>`
Users can't enter any more than 50 chars into the text field with the *maxlength* set to a value of 50.

The `<input>` type of *url* displays a text box similar to what the `<input>` type of *text* provides. However, it validates that the text in the box matches the format of a valid URL.

> EXAM TIP:
    You can validate data in many ways. Even more options become available in HTML5, such as the *url* input type. Also availalbe are the *pattern* attribute and the use of regular expressions in JS. Both of these are discussed later in this chapter.

Instead of *http://www.contoso.com* and require more flexibility and want to accept partially entered URL info, such as *costoso.com*, don't use the *url* input box. A regular *text* input with a *pattern* specified would be more appropriate.

The *password* input control is the standard method of prompting users for sensitive info. As you type your password, each char is replaced with a glyph so that any onlookers can't see your password.

> EXAM TIP:
    You can't specify default text in a *password* box or write to it via JS. This is a security safeguard to help ensure that safety of passwords. However, the browsers provide a mechanism to store a password should a user choose to have the password remember by the browser.

You can use the *email* input type to ensure that the format of the text entered into the text box matches that of a valid email address.

> EXAM TIP:
    Validation of the *email* input type confirms only that the information entered matches the expected format of a valid email address. It in no way verifies that the email address itself is a valid mailbox that can receive messages.

An additional attribute available on the check box is the *checked* attribute. `<input type="checkbox" id="chkBrown" checked="checked"/>Brown`

Notice that as with all HTML elements, each *radio* input type needs a unique *id*. However, the *name* attribute ties all the radio buttons together. With the same name specified for each *radio* type, the browser knows that they are part of a group and that only one radio button of the group can be selected.

Using the *range* input type enables users to sepcify a value within a predefined range by using a slider bar.
`<input type="range" min="1" max="25" value="20"/>`
If you omit the *value* attribute, the range defaults to the minimum value.

The `<input>` element supports three types of button controls: *submit, reset, and button*.

> EXAM TIP:
    Anything can be a "button." Bc most DOM elements have a *click* event or at least a *mousedown* and *mouseup* event, the concept of clicking can be captured and custom actions processed. This can inherently turn any part of the DOM into a "button".

The *submit* input type tells the HTML form to post its info to the server (or, in some cases, to another site or webpage). The *reset* type automatically clears all form elements to their default values. The *button* type provides a generic button with no predefined functionality.

If you want to present info to users in elements such as text boxes but don't want them to be able to alter this data, use the *readonly* attribute.

The *spellcheck* attribute helps provide feedback to users that a word they've entered is misspelled.
`<textarea id="otherCommentsText" rows="5" cols="20" spellcheck="true"></textarea>`

Suppose you don't want users to have to specify the HTTP protocol in a *url* type, but you want to allow only *.com* or *.ca* websites. This can be achieved by using the *pattern* attribute, which allows the use of a regular expression to define the pattern that should be accepted.

> EXAM TIP:
    The *pattern* attribute applies only to text boxes. It can't be used to override the validation built into the *email* or *url* types.

The following code shows the *pattern* attribute used to achieve the desired validation:
`<input type="text" title="Only .com and .ca are permitted." pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+.(.com|.ca)$"/>`
Plenty of reg expression are available to validate a URL; this one is fairly simple. When specifying the *pattern* attribute, you should specify the *title* attribute as well. The *title* attribute specifies the error message to users in the tooltip when validation fails.

The *placeholder* attribute enables you to prompt users with what's expected in a certain text box.
Example: `<input type="email" placeholder="me@mydomain.com" /></td>`

To ensure that a user fills in a field, use the *required* attribute with the `<input>` element.
Example: `<input type="email" placeholder="me@mydomain.com" required/>`
