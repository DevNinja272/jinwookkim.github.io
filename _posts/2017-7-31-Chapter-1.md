*Notes*

*Elements vs Tags: HTML markup is referred to as both HTML tags and HTML elements. These terms are often used interchangeably. This refers to the HTML markup as elements.*

### Objective 1.1: Create the document structure
* **Use HTML5 semantic markup**:

    Table 1-1 (page 3) - article, aside, figcaption, figure, footer, header, hgroup, mark, nav, progress, section.

    *Use only what you need - when designing a webpage, you don't necessarily need to use every available element. Instead, use only the elements you need to get your job done.*

    + The **header** element isn't limited to only the start of your page - it provides a semantic way of declaring the header to any area of the webpage. The header element is intended to hold an H1-H6 element as needed.
    + The **nav** alement is meant to provide users navigation through main elements of the web document.
    + The **aside** element defines any content that doesn't fall within the main flow or main content of the current page - for example, a sidebar, a note, an alert, or an advertisement.
    + The **hgroup** element is used to organize headers and subheaders.
    + The **article** element represents a whole and complete composition or entry. Ex: magazine article or a blog post. Typically, the first element within the article element is a header element or header group.
    + Similarly to the article element, the **section** element subdivides pages into section. Articles are not meant to break down into granular pieces, but sections are. Like the article element, the first element within a section element is typically a header or a header group.
    + The **figcaption** and **figure** elements, new in HTML5, provide graphics and figures to webpages. Kind of like those science textbook examples.
    + The **progress** element represents the process of an objective or task. The two supported types of progress tasks are determinate and indeterminate.
    + The **mark** element, you can easily highlight important information or any text you want to emphasize. Basically a highlighter. Just call style background color on it to choose color.

* **Create a layout container in HTML**
    + The two most common methods of creating a layout in HTML involve using **div** and **table** elements.
    + **div**s are often used to divide the page into various sections to create the layout.
    + The **table** element is very flexible with additional elements like **thead** and **tfoot**, but it is also very static in its structure. Mainly because it is not scalable.

* **Optimize for search engines**
    + Search engine optimization (SEO) is a technique used to make elements of the website easily discoverable and appropriately indexed by search engines, so that when users search for content related to your site, they find your pages.
    + The **article** and **section** elements are the main ones used by the SEO algorithm.

* **Optimize for screen readers**
    + Recommended to use **h1** elements be used solely throughout an HTML5 document. Instead of using h1-h6, keep using h1 but separated and nested with **section** elements.

* **THOUGHT EXPERIMENT:**
    + You have just been hired to convert an existing website to the new HTML5 semantic markup. Analyze the following HTML and determine what elements should be updated to fully leverage the HTML5 semantic markup:

    Initial:

* **Objective Review***
    1. Which of the following elements aren't introduced in HTML5?
        + The `<input>` element isn't new to HTML5. However, new input types have been introduced to the specification.
    2. Which element(s) does the `hgroup` element contain?
        + The `<hgroup>` element is expected to contain any or all of the `<h1>` to `<h6>` elements.
    3. Which HTML5 element would you use to organize content so that the page maximizes a search engine's algorithm?
        + The `<article>` element tells the search engine that specific content in this area is relevant to what users are searching for. This element provides for the best search engine optimization.
    4. Which HTML5 element should you use to create a more structure layout?
        + You use the `<table` element to provide a structured layout, using its rows and columns elements as needed to create the desired layout.
